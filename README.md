## Immeln - Booking site built with React

This is a hobby-project of mine built with React, MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js. The app comes with login, registration, booking and resource management through the admin panel.

What I've learned:
* How to better utilize the React framework
* Developing user authorization and authentication with technologies such as JWT
* Thinking critically about where data is accessible and how it is stored
* How to use and manage NoSQL databases

I'm learning and this repo is in no way perfect or free from errors, 

**I'm happy to recieve suggestions on where this codebase could improve in terms of readability, performance or good practice.**
